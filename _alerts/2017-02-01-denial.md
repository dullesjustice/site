<p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the government's request for an emergency stay, which
would have reinstated the Executive Order that has prevented refugees and
people from seven countries from entering the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Because the Ninth Circuit denied the stay, affected travelers
can likely enter at least until Monday afternoon.</strong></p>
