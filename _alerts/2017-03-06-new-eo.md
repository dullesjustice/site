The White House has issued a [new Executive Order on immigration and refugees](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states).

Compared to the first EO, this new action: (1) removes Iraq from the “list of seven” countries previously included under the ban, and (2) adds a 120-day hold on all refugee processing, leaving many at risk who fear for their lives or their family’s safety. The new EO goes into effect on March 16th—ten days from today.
