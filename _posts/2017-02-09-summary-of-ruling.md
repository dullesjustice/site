On February 3, 2017, the Western District of Washington issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) in favor of the State of Washington and the State of Minnesota in connection with their complaint against the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States alleging the unconstitutionality of the executive order banning entry by nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries into the United States. The defendants moved for an emergency stay of the temporary restraining order.

On February 9, 2017, [the Ninth Circuit held](http://bit.ly/2kxQA0l) that while the TRO was similar enough in its function to a preliminary injunction that it merited appellate review, the government did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or that failure to grant the motion would cause it irreparable harm, and therefore denied the motion.

The three-judge panel held that:

1. Washington and Minnesota have standing to challenge the executive order because of the harms to their interests that have resulted from the travel ban in connection with students and faculty of state universities being affected by the travel ban.
2. Federal courts have the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive actions on matters of immigration and national security, despite the government’s argument to the contrary.
3. The government has not shown a sufficient likelihood that it will succeed on appeal particularly in light of the gravity of the petitioners’ concerns about religious freedom
4. The government failed to show a sufficient likelihood that the executive order provides sufficient procedural due process rights to affected persons.
5. The court acknowledged the gravity of the states’ religious discrimination concerns and declined to further address them at this time.
6. The states and the parties they represent are likely to suffer substantial irreparable injury from the removal of the TRO. These risks, and the public interest in freedom of travel and freedom from religious discrimination, outweigh the government’s concern about the damages it may suffer from the judiciary exercising a check on executive power.

The court also declined to narrow the scope of the TRO, upholding its application to lawful permanent residents, holders of non-immigrant visas, and upholding its application nationwide.
