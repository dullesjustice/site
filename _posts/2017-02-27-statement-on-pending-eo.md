Washington, D.C., February 27, 2017—Anticipating a new immigration executive order to be issued by the Trump Administration this week, the Dulles Justice Coalition (DJC) plans to continue its on-the-ground operation at Dulles International Airport to help residents, refugees, and visitors that have been impacted by the first executive order and may be affected by the new one.

For the last month, the Dulles Justice Coalition has been on the ground helping families navigate the effects of the immigration executive order put into place on Friday, January 27. Even after the the Ninth Circuit’s unanimous decision to reject the Department of Justice’s emergency motion for a stay, DJC’s presence has provided comfort and confidence to those feeling unsure about their future.

Over the weekend, Dulles Justice welcomed 70 people to their second volunteer training, committed to stand with them at Dulles in the days to come. More than 50 are confirmed for a third training on Wednesday evening.

“We will continue to have a presence. If and when a new EO is and issued, if it is at all similar to the last one, we will fight against it. We will fight it on the ground at Dulles and we will fight it through the courts, just like last time,” said Mirriam Seddiq, Immigration Attorney and Dulles Justice volunteer.
